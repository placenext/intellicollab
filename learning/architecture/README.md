# Microservices Architecture in IntelliCollab

## Overview

IntelliCollab is built on a modern microservices architecture, which allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of individual components. This architecture provides several benefits, including improved fault isolation, technology diversity, and better team autonomy.

## Key Components

### 1. API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests and provides the following functions:

- **Request Routing**: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate microservice
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Verifies user identity and permissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests
- **Request/Response Transformation**: Modifies requests and responses as needed

```typescript
// Sample code from API Gateway routing
import express from "express";
import { createProxyMiddleware } from "http-proxy-middleware";

const app = express();

// Route to Auth Service
app.use(
  "/auth",
  createProxyMiddleware({
    target: "http://auth-service:3001",
    changeOrigin: true,
  })
);

// Route to Chat Service
app.use(
  "/chat",
  createProxyMiddleware({
    target: "http://chat-service:3002",
    changeOrigin: true,
  })
);
```

### 2. Auth Service

The Auth Service handles user authentication and authorization:

- User registration and login
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password management and security

### 3. Chat Service (Planned)

Will handle real-time chat functionality:

- Message persistence
- Chat room management
- Message delivery

### 4. User Service (Planned)

Will manage user profiles and relationships:

- User profile management
- User search and discovery
- Social connections

## Service Communication

Services in IntelliCollab communicate through two primary methods:

### 1. Synchronous Communication (REST APIs)

Used for direct request-response patterns where an immediate response is required.

```typescript
// Example of a service making a REST call to another service
async function getUserDetails(userId: string) {
  const response = await fetch(`http://user-service:3003/users/${userId}`);
  return await response.json();
}
```

### 2. Asynchronous Communication (Message Queue)

Used for events that don't require immediate processing. IntelliCollab uses Redis as a message broker for this purpose.

```typescript
// Example of publishing a message to Redis
import { createClient } from "redis";

const publisher = createClient();

async function publishUserEvent(userId: string, event: string) {
  await publisher.connect();
  await publisher.publish(
    "user:events",
    JSON.stringify({
      userId,
      event,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    })
  );
  await publisher.disconnect();
}
```

## Data Management

Each service manages its own data, following the Database-per-Service pattern:

- **Auth Service**: Stores user credentials and authentication data
- **Chat Service**: Stores messages and chat room information
- **User Service**: Stores user profiles and relationship data

## Deployment and Scaling

All services are containerized using Docker, allowing for:

- Independent scaling of services based on load
- Isolated runtime environments
- Consistent deployment across development and production

## Observability

The architecture includes a comprehensive observability stack:

- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from all services
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and provides dashboards
- **Loki**: Aggregates logs from all services

## Practical Exercise

1. Draw a diagram of the IntelliCollab architecture, including all services and their communication patterns.
2. Create a new service from scratch and integrate it with the existing platform.
3. Design a new microservice for IntelliCollab and describe how it would integrate with the existing architecture.
